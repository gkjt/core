#### Terms and Conditions - V1.0

Welcome to CSLib! We are a student-run society providing extra-curricular computing services, and allowing students to get first-hand experience with enterprise hardware and software.

In order to allow everyone to have fun and learn together with minimal disruption, these terms serve as a guide of what is considered 'fair use' of our infrastructure, so that everyone can get something out of it.


a) Obvious things

Our equipment is kindly hosted by ECS and iSolutions at the University of Southampton, and as such the use of our equipment is governed by the same regulations and policies as conventional internet access at the university. More information is available at https://www.southampton.ac.uk/isolutions/regs.page

This means don't use our network for things you wouldn't do on your own laptop connected to the university network, for instance:

DO NOTN'T access illegal material.
DO NOTN'T infringe copyright, e.g. by torrenting media.
DO NOTN'T host your pirated movie/music/tv collection.
DO NOTN'T attack University or CSLib infrastructure.
DO NOTN'T attack VMs which aren't yours or machines on the internet.
DO NOTN'T compromise the security of our network, e.g. by facilitating access from outside the university.
DO NOTN'T degrade the experience of others, e.g. by consuming excessive resources.

In short,
DO NOTN'T facilitate actions which degrade the relationship between CSLib and the university.



b) Educational Use

We provide these services as a method of learning. However, we can not guarantee their availability, uptime, or persistance.

This means that they should NOT be used for projects which matter, such as your Third Year Project, GDP, or other important assessments.

We cannot guarantee the availability of any data you store on CSLib infrastructure at any time. It may be irrecoverably deletedcould disappear for some reason the day before your deadline, either temporarily or permanently. 

In short:

DO NOTN'T use our resources to store your coursework/reports.
DO NOTN'T host a server for your viva demo.
DO NOTN'T take the risk of all your data disappearing.
DO use the ECS Supported VM Service at https://selfservice.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ for educational projects.



c) Personal/Commercial Use

These services are provided strictly for educational use. This means that you are not allowed to personally benefit from CSLib in any other way other than the knowledge experience you gain.

Our services are not for commercial use. You are not allowed to host things for non-members of the university, or companies.

This means, for example:

DO NOTN'T mine cryptocurrency using our resources.
DO NOTN'T run your startup's mailserver on our infrastructure.
DO NOTN'T host any other service from which external entities will gain, e.g. a web indexer for a company.
DO NOTN'T host a Tor Relay or Exit Node.



Failure to adhere to these terms and conditions could result in your access to our services being removed, either temporarily or permanently.
In serious cases of abuse which affect more than just our network, your information will be sharedwe will share your information with the relevant university authorities.

The CSLib core team reserve the right to change these terms at any time, and will inform our users through an email to the CSLib mailing list if there are any changes.
