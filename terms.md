## Terms and Conditions - V0.2

Last edited on: **25th August 2017**

Welcome to CSLib! We are a student-run society providing extra-curricular computing services, and allowing students to get first-hand experience with enterprise hardware and software.

In order to allow everyone to have fun and learn together with minimal disruption, these terms serve to explain what is considered 'fair use' of our infrastructure and services, so that everyone can get something out of it.


### Obvious Things

Our equipment is kindly hosted by ECS and iSolutions at the University of Southampton, and as such the use of our equipment is governed by the same regulations and policies as conventional internet access at the university.
More information is available at https://www.southampton.ac.uk/isolutions/regs.page.

This means you can't use our network for things you wouldn't do on your own laptop connected to the university network or a university system.
For example:

* **DO NOT** access or distribute illegal material.
* **DO NOT** infringe copyright, e.g. by torrenting media.
* **DO NOT** host any pirated content, code or software.
* **DO NOT** attempt to attack or exploit University or CSLib infrastructure.
* **DO NOT** attack VMs which aren't yours - with the exception of SUCSS (Southampton University Cyber Security Society) challenge VMs. These will be clearly indicated by the society committee.
* **DO NOT** attack other systems or services on the internet.
* **DO NOT** compromise the security of our network, e.g. by facilitating access from outside the university.
* **DO NOT** degrade the experience of others, e.g. by consuming excessive resources on services outside of our high-compute infrastructure.

#### In Short
* **DO NOT** facilitate actions which degrade the relationship between CSLib and the university.



### Educational Use

We will make every effort to have a full uptime across all the services we provide.
However, these services are provided as a platform for learning, therefore we can not guarantee their availability, uptime, or persistance.
This means that they should **NOT** be used for critial projects, such as your Third Year Project, GDP, or other important assessments.

We aim to take and archive regular backups of our systems to ensure we are able to recover in the event of a disaster.
However, we cannot guarantee the availability of any data you store on any of the CSLib infrastructure at any time.
Data may be irrecoverably lost at any time for a number of reasons.

By using our services you acknowledge these risks and agree that CSLib nor The University of Southampton can be held liable for any loss or inconvience you may encounter by using our services.

#### In Short
* **DO NOT** use our resources to store your coursework/reports.
* **DO NOT** host a server for your viva demo.
* **DO NOT** take the risk of putting a single copy of important data onto our services.
* **DO** use the ECS Supported VM Service at https://selfservice.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ for more critical educational projects.
* **DO** use our systems for learning and personal backups.



### Personal/Commercial Use

These services are provided strictly for personal and educational use.
This means that you may not personally benefit from CSLib in any other way other than the knowledge and experience you gain.
You are permitted to host personal services such as projects and websites but these must be solely for personal or educational use only.

Our services are not for commercial use in any way.
You many not host things for non-University members, or external companies.

#### In Short
* **DO NOT** mine any form of cryptocurrency using our computing resources.
* **DO NOT** run your startup's mailserver on our infrastructure.
* **DO NOT** host any other service from which external entities will gain, e.g. a web indexer for a company.
* **DO NOT** host a Tor Relay or Exit Node.


### Ignorance of Terms

Failure to adhere to these terms and conditions could result in your access to our services being removed, either temporarily or permanently.
In serious cases of abuse which extend further than our network, your information will be shared with the relevant university authorities who will deal with the situation accordingly.

The CSLib core team reserve the right to change these terms at any time, and will inform our users via an email to the CSLib mailing list of any changes made.

Ignorance of these terms is not an acceptable defense of infringment.
Exceptions to these terms may be granted with explicit written permission of the core CSLib committee and Julian Field of ECS.
