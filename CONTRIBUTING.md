### Got an idea for a CSLib Service?

**Found a Retro Server that needs to be revived?**

**Need access to a service that might benefit others in the Uni too?**

_Here's what you do:_

0. _Check someone else hasn't already suggested it!_ Then read the FAQ's
1. Add an issue to this repo with your idea. Explain what it is, why you want it (fun is a valid reason!), and what you need for it to work. 
2. Discuss the idea, argue your case, and wait for an admin to label it approved. Be ready for the admins to suggest tweaks or say no as our infrastructure is limited. If you need something specific, lots of resources/permissions, or something we just can't do then don't take it to heart - We want you to be able to do it too, but we can't do everything!
3. Got approval? Build it! Spin up a VM, make a template we can use, and update the issue as you go. Talk to us in Slack, get people to help you, do whatever you need to do to get it running.
4. Release it, let us know where it is, if it isn't on the CSLib infrastructure already then talk to an admin and export an image we can use.

### Not got an idea but want to help?
* Look at the issues! Find someone else with an idea and see if they want any help with it, but remember, you aren't entitled to help with their project. Don't take a no personally, just find another cool idea
* Check in Slack! We have an active Slack workspace, talk to an admin if you want to get into it (open to any current University of Southampton Student)
